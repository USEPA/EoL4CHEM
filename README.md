# EoL4Chem

EoL4Chem are Python scripts written to track chemical waste flows and identify recycling, energy recovery, treatment & disposal facilities (RETDFs) located across the United States of America, using publicly-available databases. EoL4Chem uses the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s [Chemical Data Reporting (CDR)](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-data-reporting) to gather information about potential post-recycling scenarios for recycled chemicals (e.g., fuel or fuel agent). EoL4Chem integrates the [PAU4Chem](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem) repository, which transforms data for performing chemical flow analysis for pollution abatement units (PAUs) or on-site end-of-life (EoL) operations (e.g., distillation). Also, EoL4Chem incorporates the physical properties (e.g., boiling point) from [another repository](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/Properties_Scraper) that retrieves the properties using web scraping and automatization. These properties support chemical flow analysis performance.

## Requirements:

This code was written using Python 3.x, Anaconda 3, and operating system Ubuntu 18.04. The following Python libraries are required for running the code:

1. [pandas](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas)
2. [numpy](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/numpy)
3. [argparse](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/argparse)
4. [plotly](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly)
5. [plotly-orca](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly-orca)
6. [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)
7. [holoviews](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/holoviews)
8. [matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)
9. [seaborn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn)

## 2. How to use

To run the Python script for the n-hexane case study, you need to navigate to the directory containing circular.py, i.e., [circular](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/EoL4Chem/tree/main/transform/circular) folder whose full path is */EoL4Chem/transform/circular/*. Then, you execute the following command either on Windows CMD or Unix terminal:

```
python circular.py -CAS 110543 -N_cycles 100
```
or default running conditions

```
python circular.py
```
