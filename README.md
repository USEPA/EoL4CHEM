# EoL4Chem

EoL4Chem is a code written in Python. It uses different publicly available databases from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) and others. This is used to track chemicals contained in an industrial waste stream across the U.S. territory, considering waste
brokering. Besides, this code is utilized to create a database called EoL database, where the North American Industrial Classification 
System (NAICS) is used to cluster the waste handlers, the chemicals are clustered based on hazards using their chemical structure, 
and the EoU activities (e.g., solvent recovery) are clustered as well.
