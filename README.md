# EoL4Chem

EoL4Chem are Python scripts written to track chemical waste flows and identify recycling, energy recovery, treatment & disposal facilities (RETDFs) located across the United States of America, using publicly-available databases. EoL4Chem uses the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's [Chemical Data Reporting (CDR)](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-data-reporting) to gather information about potential post-recycling scenarios for recycled chemicals (e.g., fuel or fuel agent). EoL4Chem integrates the [PAU4Chem](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem) repository, which transforms data for performing chemical flow analysis for pollution abatement units (PAUs) or on-site end-of-life (EoL) operations (e.g., distillation). Also, EoL4Chem incorporates the physical properties (e.g., boiling point) from [another repository](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/Properties_Scraper) that retrieves the properties using web scraping and automatization. These properties support chemical flow analysis performance.
