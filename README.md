# EoL4Chem

EoL4Chem are Python scripts written to track chemical waste flows and identify recycling, energy recovery, treatment & disposal facilities (RETDFs) located across the United States of America, using publicly-available databases. EoL4Chem uses the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s [Chemical Data Reporting (CDR)](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-data-reporting) to gather information about potential post-recycling scenarios for recycled chemicals (e.g., fuel or fuel agent). EoL4Chem integrates the [PAU4Chem](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PAU4Chem) repository, which transforms data for performing chemical flow analysis for pollution abatement units (PAUs) or on-site end-of-life (EoL) operations (e.g., distillation). Also, EoL4Chem incorporates the physical properties (e.g., boiling point) from [another repository](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/Properties_Scraper) that retrieves the properties using web scraping and automatization. These properties support chemical flow analysis performance.

## Requirements

This code was written using Python 3.x, Anaconda 3, and operating system Ubuntu 18.04. You can create a conda environment called EoL4Chem by running the following command after installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) in your computer:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The case study needs the files obtained by data engineering, which are in [transform](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/EoL4Chem/tree/main/transform). The [extract](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/EoL4Chem/tree/main/extract) folder contains all the files retrieved by web scraping and automatization, which together [ancillary](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/EoL4Chem/tree/main/ancillary) folder files (e.g., fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP)) support the data engineering process.

### Ovoiding ModuleNotFoundError and ImportError

If you are working as a Python programmer, you should avoid both ```ModuleNotFoundError``` and ```ImportError```. Thus, follow the steps below to solve the above mentioned problems:

<ol>
   <li>
    Open the .bashrc file with the text editor of your preference (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
        
    code ~/.bashrc
   </li>
   <li>
    Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following lines
       
    export PACKAGE=$(locate -br '^EoL4Chem$')
    export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$PACKAGE"
   </li>
   <li>
    Save the file with the changes
   </li>
   <li>
    You can open another terminal to verify that the variable has been successfully saved by running the following command
    
    echo $PYTHONPATH
   </li>
</ol>

## How to use

To run the Python script for the n-hexane case study, you need to navigate to the directory containing circular.py, i.e., [circular](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/EoL4Chem/tree/main/transform/circular) folder whose full path is */EoL4Chem/transform/circular/*. Then, you execute the following command on Unix terminal:

```
python circular.py -CAS 110543 -N_cycles 100
```
or

```
python circular.py
```

## Outputs

After running the Python script you obtain the following output files in the [circular](https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/EoL4Chem/tree/main/transform/circular) folder:

| File name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Sankey_1.pdf | Sankey diagram in Figure 4A |
| Sankey_flows_1.csv | Flows between nodes in Figure 4A |
| Sankey_2.pdf | Sankey diagram in Figure 4B |
| Sankey_flows_2.csv | Flows between nodes in Figure 4B |
| stacked_barplot.pdf | Stacked bar plot or Figure 5 |
| chord_waste.pdf | Chord diagram or Figure 6 |
| chord_waste.csv | Labels for industry sectors in Figure 6 |
| chord_recyled.pdf | Chord diagram or Figure 7 |
| chord_recyled.csv | Labels for industry sectors in Figure 7 |
| seaborn_heatmap_non_industrial.pdf | Plot for chemical cross-contamination or Figure 8 |
